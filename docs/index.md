# GitHub PR Review Spec MCP

Welcome to the documentation portal for the GitHub PR Review Spec Maker MCP server. This site consolidates onboarding, deployment, and reference material to help humans and MPC-compatible agents integrate the server safely and efficiently.

Use the navigation sidebar to explore focused guides:

- **Getting Started** provides quick installation tutorials using `uv`, pip, or container images.
- **Guides** walk through common agent integrations, remote hosting topologies, and operational checklists.
- **Reference** captures protocol tooling, CLI commands, environment variables, and API schemas.
- **Architecture** explains system design, data flow, and security guardrails.
- **Contributing** documents the development workflow and quality gates for maintainers.
- **Security** highlights mandatory safeguards, threat models, and limitations of automated PR implementation.

If you are new to MCP, start with [Getting Started](getting-started/quickstart.md) and [Concepts](architecture/overview.md) before configuring the server inside your agent environment.
